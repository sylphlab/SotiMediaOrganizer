# MediaCurator (@sotilab/smo)
<!-- Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: 2025-04-06 | Updated By: Cline -->

**MediaCurator** is your ultimate tool for intelligently curating, organizing,
and decluttering your digital photo and video collection. Whether you're a
casual photographer or a seasoned professional, MediaCurator offers powerful
solutions to bring order to your growing media library, efficiently and
effortlessly. Built with a focus on performance, scalability, and robustness using modern TypeScript and functional programming principles.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Smart Organization**: Automatically organizes photos and videos by metadata
  like creation date, geolocation, and camera model using a flexible format string.
- **Advanced Deduplication**: Eliminate duplicate/similar files using perceptual hashing and a scalable DB-centric approach with Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) stored in SQLite.
- **Blazing Performance**: Optimized for speed with Sharp (libvips), Fluent-FFmpeg, SQLite (`better-sqlite3`), and WASM for core calculations (Hamming distance).
- **Functional &amp; Robust Architecture**: Built with TypeScript using functional programming principles (`neverthrow` for error handling) and Manual Dependency Injection for clarity and testability. Core logic is decomposed into a clear pipeline (`discovery`, `gatherer`, `deduplicator`, `transfer`).
- **Scalable Metadata Storage**: Utilizes SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) for efficient storage and querying of metadata for potentially millions of files.
- **Efficient Caching**: Leverages LMDB for caching intermediate processing results (file stats, metadata, hashes), enabling pause/resume and faster re-runs.
- **Wide Format Support**: Handles a vast range of image and video formats via FFmpeg and Sharp. Extend support by recompiling underlying libraries (libvips, FFmpeg) if needed.
- **Refined CLI Experience**: Centralized reporting via `CliReporter` provides clear progress indicators (spinners, progress bars) and logging, controllable with a `--verbose` flag.
- **Concurrency**: Employs `workerpool` for parallel processing of CPU-intensive tasks like perceptual hash generation.

Use these prefixes for different date sources:
- `I.` : Image metadata date (e.g., EXIF Original Date)
- `F.` : File system creation date
- `D.` : Mixed date (prefers image metadata date `I.`, falls back to file creation date `F.`)

Available formats for each prefix:
- `{*.YYYY}` : Year (4 digits)
- `{*.YY}` : Year (2 digits)
- `{*.MMMM}` : Month (full name, e.g., January)

```

## üîç Sophisticated Deduplication (LSH Powered)

MediaCurator employs a robust, database-centric approach using Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for efficient and scalable deduplication:

1.  **Metadata &amp; pHash Generation**: For each file, extract metadata, calculate a content hash (for caching via LMDB), and generate a perceptual hash (pHash). Store essential info (path, pHash, duration, resolution, LSH keys) in the SQLite database (`MetadataDBService`). Adaptive frame extraction is used for videos.
2.  **Exact Duplicate Detection**: Query the SQLite database for files sharing the *exact same pHash*. These form initial "exact match" clusters.
3.  **Similarity Candidate Search (LSH)**: For files not part of exact duplicate sets, use their pre-calculated LSH keys to efficiently query the SQLite database. This retrieves a small set of *potential* similar candidates, drastically reducing the number of comparisons needed compared to checking all pairs.
4.  **Similarity Verification**: Fetch the necessary `MediaInfo` (pHash, duration, etc.) from the database only for the target file and its LSH candidates. Calculate the precise perceptual similarity (e.g., Hamming distance for pHashes) between the target and each candidate.
5.  **Similarity Clustering**: Group the target file with candidates that meet the configured similarity thresholds (different thresholds can be set for image-image, image-video, video-video comparisons).
6.  **Cluster Merging**: Combine the exact duplicate clusters (from Step 2) and the similarity clusters (from Step 5) into final duplicate sets.
7.  **Smart File Selection**: Within each final cluster, select the best representative file(s) based on a scoring system (considering duration, resolution, metadata completeness).
    - If the highest-scoring item is an image, only that image is kept as unique.
    - If the highest-scoring item is a video, that video is kept, along with any unique, high-quality images from the same cluster that are not overly similar to each other.

This LSH-based approach significantly improves scalability for large collections by avoiding N^2 comparisons.

### Supported Scenarios

### Leveraging FFmpeg and libvips for Comprehensive Format Support

MediaCurator relies on the powerful decoding capabilities of FFmpeg and libvips
to handle a wide range of media formats. While the default installations of
these libraries cover most common formats, you may need to compile them with
additional codecs to support specialized or proprietary formats.

#### Expanding FFmpeg Support

FFmpeg is used primarily for video processing in MediaCurator. To enable support
for additional video codecs:

1. Download the FFmpeg source code from the
   [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

2. Configure FFmpeg with the additional codecs you need. For example:

   ```bash
   ./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-libx265 --enable-libvpx --enable-libopus
   ```

   This configuration enables support for H.264, H.265, VP8/VP9, and Opus
   codecs.

3. Compile and install FFmpeg:

   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

Common video formats that might require additional codec support:

- HEVC/H.265
- VP9
- AV1
- ProRes

#### Enhancing libvips Capabilities

libvips is used for image processing in MediaCurator. To add support for more
image formats:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies. For Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libheif-dev libopenexr-dev libwebp-dev
   ```

2. Download the libvips source code from the
   [libvips GitHub repository](https://github.com/libvips/libvips).

3. Configure libvips with additional format support:

   ```bash
   ./configure --enable-heif --enable-openexr --enable-webp
   ```

4. Compile and install libvips:

   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

Common image formats that might require additional support:

- HEIF/HEIC (common in newer iPhones)
- OpenEXR
- WebP

#### Integrating Custom Builds with MediaCurator

After compiling FFmpeg and libvips with extended format support:

1. Ensure the custom-built libraries are in your system's library path.
2. If you're using a package manager like npm or yarn, you might need to rebuild
   the node modules that depend on these libraries:

   ```bash
   npm rebuild sharp
   npm rebuild fluent-ffmpeg
   ```

3. Restart your MediaCurator application to use the newly compiled libraries.

#### Note on Proprietary Codecs

Some codecs (like H.264 and H.265) may require licensing for commercial use.
Ensure you have the necessary rights or licenses when enabling support for these
codecs.

By following these steps, you can significantly expand MediaCurator's ability to
handle various media formats, allowing for more comprehensive organization of
your media collection. Remember that enabling support for additional formats may
increase the size of your application and potentially impact performance, so
consider enabling only the formats you actually need.

### üèéÔ∏è High-Performance Engine

MediaCurator is built for speed and scale:

- **Scalable Metadata Storage**: Uses SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) for efficient storage and indexed querying of metadata, crucial for handling millions of files.
- **Efficient Similarity Search (LSH)**: Employs Locality-Sensitive Hashing keys stored and queried in SQLite to rapidly find potential duplicates, avoiding costly N^2 comparisons.
- **Optimized Calculations**: Uses WASM (compiled AssemblyScript) for lightning-fast Hamming distance calculations during similarity verification.
- **Concurrency**: Leverages worker threads (`workerpool`) for parallel perceptual hash generation, maximizing CPU utilization.
- **Robust Caching (LMDB)**: Utilizes LMDB for high-speed caching of intermediate results (file stats, metadata, hashes), enabling quick resumption and avoiding redundant computations.
- **Functional Pipeline**: A clear, functional pipeline architecture enhances maintainability and testability.
