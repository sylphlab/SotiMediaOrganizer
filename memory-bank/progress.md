# Project Progress

- **Current Status:** Renaming, refactoring, and optimization phase completed.
- **What Works:**
  - Memory Bank structure initialized and populated with detailed project analysis.
  - Project renamed to MediaCurator across relevant files.
  - Core logic refactored for better separation of concerns (DebugReporter, FileTransferService).
  - WASM optimization for Hamming distance integrated.
- **What's Next / To Be Built:**
  - Further testing (manual or automated) would be beneficial.
  - Potential further optimizations (e.g., DTW, worker communication).
- **Known Issues/Blockers:**
  - Husky pre-commit hook shows deprecation warnings (needs update in `.husky/pre-commit`).
  - Test suite (`tests/index.js`) seems minimal or non-functional based on pre-commit output.
