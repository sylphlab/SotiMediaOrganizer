# Project Progress

- **Current Status:** Completed Phase 1 refactoring. ESLint parsing error in `src/jobs/adaptiveExtraction.ts` resolved. Ready to commit Phase 1 changes.
- **What Works:**
  - Memory Bank structure initialized.
  - Project renamed to MediaCurator.
  - Core logic significantly refactored towards functional style (using `neverthrow` for `Result`).
  - Dependency Injection framework (`inversify`) removed; Manual Injection implemented.
  - `Context.ts` and related service wrappers removed.
  - WASM optimization for Hamming distance integrated.
  - Basic Jest setup complete.
  - Unit tests for `src/utils.ts` and most helpers in `src/comparatorUtils.ts` are passing.
  - Husky pre-commit hook updated.
  - ESLint parsing error in `src/jobs/adaptiveExtraction.ts` fixed.
- **What's Next / To Be Built:**
  - **Commit Phase 1:** Successfully commit the completed Phase 1 changes.
  - **Major Refactoring (Phase 2 - Scalability):**
    - Implement SQLite DB module (`better-sqlite3`).
    - Refactor pipeline stages (`Gathering`, `Deduplication`) for SQLite usage (streaming/batching).
    - Optimize/Re-evaluate deduplication algorithm (VPTree/DBSCAN).
    - Refine worker implementation.
    - Introduce benchmarking.
  - **Major Refactoring (Phase 3 - UI):**
    - Refine CLI output/progress/errors.
    - (Deferred) Web UI foundation.
  - **Testing (Post-Refactoring):**
    - Develop a comprehensive test suite covering the refactored code.
- **Known Issues/Blockers:**
  - Persistent issues mocking `fs.existsSync` and/or `crypto.randomBytes` within `bun test` environment (relevant for future testing).
  - Test coverage is low pending completion of major refactoring (Phase 4).
