# Project Progress

- **Current Status:** Paused testing to plan a major architectural refactoring towards functional programming, improved UI, and scalability, as per user request.
- **What Works:**
  - Memory Bank structure initialized.
  - Project renamed to MediaCurator.
  - Core logic partially refactored towards functional style.
  - WASM optimization for Hamming distance integrated.
  - Basic Jest setup complete.
  - Unit tests for `src/utils.ts` and most helpers in `src/comparatorUtils.ts` are passing.
- **What's Next / To Be Built:**
  - **Major Refactoring (New Task):**
    - Adopt a more functional programming style throughout the codebase.
    - Re-evaluate and potentially replace the DI framework (Inversify).
    - Design and implement UI improvements (potentially Web UI).
    - Ensure architecture scales to handle millions of media files.
  - **Testing (Post-Refactoring):**
    - Develop a comprehensive test suite covering the refactored code.
  - Update Husky pre-commit hook.
- **Known Issues/Blockers:**
  - Persistent issues mocking `fs.existsSync` and/or `crypto.randomBytes` within `bun test` environment (relevant for future testing).
  - Husky pre-commit hook shows deprecation warnings.
  - Test coverage is low pending refactoring and further test development.
