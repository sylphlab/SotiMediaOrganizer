# Project Progress

- **What Works:**
  - Memory Bank structure initialized and populated.
  - Project renamed to MediaCurator.
  - Core logic refactored (DebugReporter, FileTransferService).
  - WASM optimization for Hamming distance integrated.
  - Basic Jest setup complete.
  - Unit tests for `src/utils.ts` created and passing.
  - Partial unit tests for `src/services/FileTransferService.ts` created (helper functions passing, path generation tests failing due to mocking issues).
- **What's Next / To Be Built:**
  - Functional refactoring of the codebase (New Task).
  - Comprehensive test suite after refactoring (New Task).
- **Known Issues/Blockers:**
  - Persistent issues mocking `fs.existsSync` and/or `crypto.randomBytes` within `bun test` environment for `FileTransferService.test.ts`.
  - Husky pre-commit hook shows deprecation warnings (needs update in `.husky/pre-commit`).
