# Project Progress

- **Current Status:** Completed Phase 1 refactoring and committed changes. Started Phase 2 (Scalability) by integrating `MetadataDBService` for exact pHash matching in `deduplicator.ts` and committing changes. Approved DB-centric LSH strategy for similarity search.
- **What Works:**
  - Memory Bank structure initialized.
  - Project renamed to MediaCurator.
  - Core logic significantly refactored towards functional style (using `neverthrow` for `Result`).
  - Dependency Injection framework (`inversify`) removed; Manual Injection implemented.
  - `Context.ts` and related service wrappers removed.
  - WASM optimization for Hamming distance integrated.
  - Basic Jest setup complete.
  - Unit tests for `src/utils.ts` and most helpers in `src/comparatorUtils.ts` are passing.
  - Husky pre-commit hook updated.
  - ESLint parsing error in `src/jobs/adaptiveExtraction.ts` fixed.
  - Added `better-sqlite3` dependency.
  - Integrated `MetadataDBService` into `deduplicator.ts` for exact pHash matching.
- **What's Next / To Be Built:**
  - **Major Refactoring (Phase 2 - Scalability):**
    - Implement DB-centric LSH strategy:
      - Modify DB schema/service for LSH keys.
      - Refactor `deduplicator.ts` to use LSH queries instead of VPTree/DBSCAN.
    - Refactor pipeline stages (`Gathering`, `Deduplication`) for efficient SQLite usage (streaming/batching).
    - Refine worker implementation (if needed).
    - Introduce benchmarking.
  - **Major Refactoring (Phase 3 - UI):**
    - Refine CLI output/progress/errors.
    - (Deferred) Web UI foundation.
  - **Testing (Post-Refactoring):**
    - Develop a comprehensive test suite covering the refactored code.
- **Known Issues/Blockers:**
  - Persistent issues mocking `fs.existsSync` and/or `crypto.randomBytes` within `bun test` environment (relevant for future testing).
  - Test coverage is low pending completion of major refactoring (Phase 4).
  - Current VPTree/DBSCAN implementation in `MediaComparator` relies on in-memory data and is not scalable (being replaced in Phase 2).
