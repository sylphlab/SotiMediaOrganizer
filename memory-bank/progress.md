# Project Progress

- **Current Status:** Completed initial refactoring for Phase 3 UI improvements by centralizing CLI output into `CliReporter`.
- **What Works:**
  - Memory Bank structure initialized.
  - Project renamed to MediaCurator.
  - Core logic significantly refactored towards functional style (using `neverthrow` for `Result`).
  - Dependency Injection framework (`inversify`) removed; Manual Injection implemented.
  - `Context.ts` and related service wrappers removed.
  - WASM optimization for Hamming distance integrated.
  - Basic Jest setup complete.
  - Unit tests for `src/utils.ts` and most helpers in `src/comparatorUtils.ts` are passing.
  - Husky pre-commit hook updated.
  - ESLint parsing error in `src/jobs/adaptiveExtraction.ts` fixed.
  - Added `better-sqlite3` dependency.
  - Integrated `MetadataDBService` into `deduplicator.ts` for exact pHash matching.
  - Updated `MetadataDBService` schema and methods for LSH keys.
  - Replaced VPTree/DBSCAN logic in `deduplicator.ts` with LSH-based similarity clustering.
  - **Phase 3:** Centralized CLI reporting service (`CliReporter`) created and integrated into pipeline stages.
  - **Phase 3:** Added `--verbose` option.
- **What's Next / To Be Built:**
  - **Major Refactoring (Phase 3 - UI):**
    - Further refine `CliReporter` (e.g., better handling of logging alongside dynamic UI, aggregate error reporting).
    - Implement verbosity levels in reporter output.
  - **Major Refactoring (Phase 2 - Scalability - Postponed):**
    - **Optimization:** Refactor LSH similarity check loop in `deduplicator.ts` to fetch only necessary `MediaInfo` from DB for candidates.
    - **Workers:** Re-evaluate worker usage for pHash generation.
    - **Benchmarking:** Introduce benchmarking.
    - Refactor pipeline stages (`Gathering`, `Deduplication`) for efficient SQLite usage (streaming/batching).
  - **Testing (Phase 4 - In Progress):**
    - Added integration tests for `MetadataDBService`.
      - Develop a comprehensive test suite covering the refactored code (MetadataDBService integration tests done).
      - Add unit tests for pure functions where applicable (limited candidates found without further refactoring).
- **Known Issues/Blockers:**
  - Persistent issues mocking `fs.existsSync` and/or `crypto.randomBytes` within `bun test` environment (relevant for future testing).
  - Test coverage is low pending completion of major refactoring (Phase 4).
  - Deduplication logic in `deduplicator.ts` still relies on pre-fetched `allFileInfoMap` for candidate info (needs optimization).
  - `CliReporter` needs refinement for handling concurrent logging and dynamic UI updates gracefully.
