# Active Context

- **Current Focus:** Transitioning from test case writing to functional refactoring.
- **Recent Changes:**
  - Added Jest and related dependencies (`@types/jest`, `ts-jest`).
  - Configured Jest (`jest.config.js`, `tests/jest.setup.ts` with `reflect-metadata`).
  - Created initial test file `tests/utils.test.ts` (passing).
  - Created initial test file `tests/services/FileTransferService.test.ts`.
  - Encountered persistent issues mocking `fs.existsSync` and/or `crypto.randomBytes` within the `bun test` environment for `FileTransferService.test.ts` conflict/sanitization tests.
  - Test case writing paused based on user request.
- **Next Steps:** Initiate new task for functional refactoring as requested by user.
- **Open Questions/Decisions:** None.
