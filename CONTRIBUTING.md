# Contributing to MediaCurator

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MediaCurator! It's people like you that make open source great.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/sylphlab/MediaCurator/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/sylphlab/MediaCurator/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with the enhancement suggestion. Clearly describe the enhancement and the motivation for it.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes (`bun run test`).
5.  Make sure your code lints (`bun run lint`).
6.  Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for your commit messages.
7.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

- Follow the established code style (enforced by Prettier and ESLint). Run `bun run format` and `bun run lint:fix` before committing.

We look forward to your contributions!
